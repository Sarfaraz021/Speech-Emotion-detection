# Speech Emotion Detection

A deep learning project that detects emotions from speech signals using the RAVDESS dataset.

## Overview
This project implements a speech emotion recognition system that can classify various emotional states from audio recordings. It uses deep learning techniques to analyze speech patterns and identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.

## Dataset
The project uses the RAVDESS dataset (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song). You can access the dataset and trained models here:
